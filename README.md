# AbuseIPScanner
A log file watcher for Apache HTTP Daemon with abuseipdb.com

## Why AbuseIPScanner?
I was looking for the small monitoring tool for my personal server, 
but I could not find the one. 

The requirement I had was,

* Configurable databases set(including abuseipdb.com)
* Configurable commands after finding suspicious accessor
* Easy to use :)

## Usage
